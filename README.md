# Hi, I'm Josh Carter 👋

## About Me  
I’m a Computer Science student working on my Associate degree and currently taking CSC-113 (AI Fundamentals). I’m curious about how technology and creativity connect, and I’m especially interested in how AI can be used to make learning and development more engaging.

## My Foo 🎯  
I’m passionate about **front-end design and creating clean, user-friendly experiences**. I enjoy experimenting with visuals that make projects stand out.  
At the same time, I’m expanding into **back-end development** so I can bring my designs to life with real functionality and learn the full stack.

## Currently Learning
- 🤖 AI collaboration and prompt engineering
- 🐙 GitHub workflows and version control
- 💡 Building my first AI assistants
