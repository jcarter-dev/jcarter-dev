# Hi, I'm Josh Carter 👋

## About Me
I'm a Computer Science student working on my Associate degree and currently taking CSC-113 (AI Fundamentals). I'm curious about how technology and creativity connect, and I’m especially interested in how AI can be used to make learning and development more engaging.

## My Foo 💅🏽
I'm passionate about front-end design and creating clean, user-friendly experiences. I enjoy experimenting with visuals that make projects stand out.  
At the same time, I’m expanding into back-end development so I can bring my designs to life with real functionality and learn the full stack.

## Currently Learning
- 🤖 AI collaboration and prompt engineering  
- 🔄 GitHub workflows and version control  
- 🧠 Building my first AI assistants

### • Project Ideation: Three AI Application Ideas (CSC-113)
A brainstorming assignment for my AI Fundamentals course where I’m exploring three possible AI projects to build this semester:  
1. **AI Workflow Assistant for Java Projects** — Helps explain errors, summarize changes, and suggest small code improvements.  
2. **AI Linux Tutor** — Breaks down commands and lab outputs from my RHCSA-style Linux work so I actually understand what’s going on.  
3. **AI UI Theme Generator for Java Swing** — Generates colors, gradients, and UI constants based on short theme descriptions (teal, glass, dark mode, etc.).

This is the early planning phase for my capstone-style AI project.

## Fun Fact
I have a pet jumping spider named Pogo 🕷️ and a dog named Butter 🐶.  
I never thought I'd have a spider and a dog as roommates, but here we are 😅.
