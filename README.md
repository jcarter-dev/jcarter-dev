## Project Ideation: Three AI Application Ideas  
A brainstorming assignment for CSC-113 where I explored three possible AI applications to build this semester:

1. **AI Workflow Assistant for Java Projects**  
   Helps explain errors, summarize code changes, and suggest small improvements.

2. **AI Linux Tutor**  
   Breaks down Linux commands and RHCSA-style lab outputs in plain English.

3. **AI UI Theme Generator for Java Swing**  
   Generates color palettes, gradients, and Swing UI constants based on short theme descriptions  
   (e.g., *“teal glass,” “dark mode with cyan accents,” “retro terminal green”*).

## AI UI Theme Generator (MVP)
This is my working MVP for the semester — built through rapid prototyping, iteration logs, and GitHub workflows.
