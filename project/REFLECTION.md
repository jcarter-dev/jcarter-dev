# Final Reflection

## About My Process

### My biggest aha moment
The moment I realized the AI wasn’t guessing. It responds to whatever structure I give it. When I stopped sending vague requests and started being specific about tone, purpose, and what problem I was trying to solve, the quality of the responses changed immediately.

### A time the AI gave me something useless
Early on, it kept giving me long explanations I didn’t ask for. I had to back up and rewrite my prompts so they were clearer and more direct. Once I learned how to shut down the extra fluff, the answers became way more useful.

### How my prompting changed over the semester
At the start I was just typing questions. By the end I was giving context, goals, and constraints. The prompts turned into actual instructions instead of quick guesses. That shift made everything smoother.

## About What I Learned

### One thing I can do now that I couldn’t do in August
I can shape an idea with AI instead of letting it run wild. The assistant helped refine my workflow tool, narrow the features, and explain things in a way that actually worked for me.

### What surprised me the most
How much small wording changes matter. One sentence can flip the whole direction of the response. It’s like adjusting a dial.

### Something AI is bad at
Holding on to a direction unless I remind it. If I don’t restate the goal, it drifts. It’s powerful, but it needs guidance.

## About What Comes Next

### How I will use AI in other classes or work
For quick explanations, cleaner wording, fast summaries, and breaking down problems before I start coding. It helps me think through the messy parts so I can focus on actually writing the code.

### What I would tell someone who has never used AI
Start simple. Give it a clear task and ask for exactly what you want. Don’t expect the first answer to be perfect. Treat it like a conversation, not a vending machine.

### What I want to learn after this course
I want to get better at using AI for larger workflows. Automating things. Exploring more ways it can plug into the tools I already use.

## Honest Assessment

### My confidence now versus the start
Now I’m around eight and a half out of ten. At the beginning I was maybe a three. I understand how to lead it now. I know how to fix drift, set tone, and get useful work out of it. It’s still a prototype stage for me, but it feels like something I can actually build on.
