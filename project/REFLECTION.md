# Final Reflection

## About My Process

### My biggest aha moment
Realizing the AI is not here to read my mind. It follows structure. Once I gave it real context and real intent, the results lined up with what I actually meant. That shift changed everything.

### A time the AI gave me something useless
It happened more than once. Sometimes it drifted. Sometimes it missed the point. When that happened I stopped and reframed my prompt. Most of the failures were caused by unclear instructions on my end.

### How my prompting changed over the semester
Early on I tossed short commands at it and hoped for magic. Now I treat it like a collaborator. I give tone. I give structure. I give the purpose and the goal. It produces cleaner work because I set it up correctly.

## About What I Learned

### One thing I can do now that I couldn’t do in August
I can take a rough idea and shape it into something functional through iteration. Writing. Design. Code. I know how to guide the model instead of fighting it.

### What surprised me the most
How small changes in wording shift the entire output. Precision pays off.

### Something AI is bad at
Long term consistency. If I do not restate constraints, it forgets. If I assume it remembers everything, it does not. It is strong but not stable without direction.

## About What Comes Next

### How I will use AI in other classes or work
Drafting. Outlining. Debugging. Rewriting. Documentation. It speeds up the slow parts so I can focus on the real thinking.

### What I would tell someone who has never used AI
Start small. Make your prompt specific. Do not expect perfection on the first try. The value comes from the back and forth.

### What I want to learn beyond this course
Better integration with technical workflows. Code generation. Automation. GitHub pipelines. Design systems.

## Honest Assessment

### My confidence now versus the start
Now I am around eight and a half out of ten.  
At the start I was maybe a four and a half.  

At first I was guessing. Now I understand how to steer it, correct drift, and pull real value out of these tools. I still have more to learn but I am comfortable and capable.
