# AI Java UI Theme Helper (Prototype)

## What Is This?
This project is a prototype for an AI assisted tool that helps generate and refine UI themes for Java applications. Throughout the semester I used AI tools to design color palettes, modernize Swing layouts, clean up styling, and experiment with different looks for my Java interfaces.

## What Does It Do?
The project shows how I worked with AI to build theme ideas, test color combinations, redesign simple UI elements, and create a cleaner and more modern Java aesthetic. It includes examples of prompts I used to get feedback on theme styles, gradients, spacing, and overall visual direction.

## How Far Did I Get?
It is still a prototype. The assistant is not a full tool yet, but I created a real workflow for using AI as a design partner for Java UIs. I produced theme drafts, color variations, sample component styles, and experiments that pushed the design forward even if everything is not fully implemented.

## AI Tools I Used
ChatGPT  
Gemini  
GitHub Copilot  

These tools helped brainstorm new theme ideas, analyze color choices, suggest modern UI patterns, and rewrite pieces of Java UI code to look cleaner.
