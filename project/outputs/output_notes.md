# Output Notes

This folder is for examples of what the AI gave me during the course.

Some of the things that can go here  
Writing the AI helped me clean up  
Explanations it gave me for class topics  
Reflections that started as rough drafts and got revised  
Any small pieces of code or logic it helped me fix or explain  

Most of my work with AI this semester happened in conversations. I am using a few simple files in this folder to represent the kinds of outputs I worked with.
