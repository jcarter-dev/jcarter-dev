# Output Notes

This folder shows examples of the responses I got from the AI while shaping my AI Workflow Assistant for Java Projects. These responses helped me rewrite the idea, define the features, narrow the scope, and understand how the assistant would fit into my normal workflow.

The outputs here are short and simple because most of the work came through conversation. These examples represent the kind of help the AI gave me during the project.
