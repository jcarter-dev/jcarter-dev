This was the AI rewrite when I asked it to clean up the idea and make it sound more direct.

AI Rewrite:
The goal is to build a small assistant that turns quick theme descriptions into usable Java Swing color systems. The AI should take short natural language prompts like “teal glass panel” or “dark mode with cyan glow” and translate that into hex values, swatches, and a starter theme snippet. The tool focuses on fast idea generation, not full UI design.
