This is an example of the AI rewriting my first idea so it sounded more like a real project.

Original idea
AI tool that helps me with Java errors and code.

AI rewrite
AI Workflow Assistant for Java Projects. A small assistant that fits into my normal coding routine. It helps explain error messages in plain language, suggests cleaner ways to write certain sections, and gives short summaries of what changed between commits or versions. The goal is not to replace me. The goal is to make the process less confusing and less repetitive.

This was one of the first times the idea felt like something I could actually describe and build toward.
