This is the output I got when I asked the AI to break the idea into simple features for a first prototype.

AI Breakdown:
1. Parse short theme descriptions and detect keywords such as teal, dark, neon, sunset, etc.
2. Map those keywords to a small set of predefined palettes.
3. Render a visual preview so the user can see what the theme might look like.
4. Generate a Java Swing snippet with Color() constants for PRIMARY, SECONDARY, ACCENT, and BACKGROUND.
5. Provide a one-click copy button for the snippet.

This helped me understand what a basic version of the tool should focus on.
