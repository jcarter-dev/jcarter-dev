This was the AI helping me break the idea into simple features for a prototype.

Feature List the AI Suggested:
Explain error messages in plain language
Highlight parts of the code that look messy or confusing
Suggest cleaner structure or small improvements
Give short summaries of what changed between edits

It also said a basic prototype could be done by focusing on the first two features only. This made the project feel manageable instead of overwhelming.
