# AI Workflow Assistant for Java Projects (Prototype)

## What Is This?
This is a prototype for an AI assistant that fits into my normal Java workflow. When I’m coding, I lose time bouncing between errors, messy sections of code, rewrites, and trying to remember what changed between versions. I wanted something that could sit in the middle of all that and make the process clearer instead of more chaotic.

## What Does It Do?
The files in this folder show how I shaped the idea with AI. I used prompts to figure out what the assistant should do, what problems it solves, and what a first version would actually look like. The assistant is meant to explain errors in a human way, point out cleaner ways to write code, and summarize short updates so I’m not guessing at my own changes.

## How Far Did I Get?
Right now it’s just a prototype. I didn’t build the full tool, but I did build the structure around it. I refined the concept, narrowed the scope, and documented the features that matter. It’s a real plan with real examples, even if the application isn’t finished yet.

## AI Tools I Used
ChatGPT  
Gemini  
GitHub Copilot  

I used these tools to help shape the idea, clean up the language, define features, and figure out how this kind of assistant would actually fit into my day to day Java work.
