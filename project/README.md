# Java Swing Theme Generator (AI-Assisted Prototype)

## What Is This?
This is a prototype of a Java Swing theme generator created with help from AI tools. The goal was simple: describe a vibe in plain English and instantly get a color system, a preview, and a ready-to-paste Java snippet to theme a Swing project. The entire layout, styling, logic, and behavior were built through back-and-forth iteration with AI.

## What Does It Do?
You type a short description like “teal glass theme” or “retro terminal.” The tool analyzes a few keywords, chooses a preset, and updates:
• a full color palette  
• a Swing-style mock window preview  
• a Java theme snippet with ready hex codes  

It gives a visual mockup and real code at the same time.

## How Far Did I Get?
It is a working prototype. The keyword matching, color presets, UI layout, animations, and Java snippet output all function. It is not a full AI model, but it behaves like a compact AI helper because the entire system was generated, refined, and styled with AI prompts.

## AI Tools I Used

GitHub Copilot  

These tools helped me write the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, UI logic, gradients, color presets, animations, and the Java snippet generator. The whole design came together through iteration: I described the aesthetic I wanted, and the AI helped me build it piece by piece.
