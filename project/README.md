# AI Fundamentals Final Project

## What Is This?
This folder is the whole trail of my semester. The prompts I wrote. The experiments I pushed. The things I tried to build while figuring out how to work with AI as an actual partner instead of a guessing machine. It is honest and iterative and real.

## What Does It Do?
It shows the process. The ideas. The drafts. The rewritten pieces. The half finished attempts. The parts that worked. The parts that didn’t. The moments where the AI surprised me or confused me. It is not a product. It is a map of how my thinking took shape.

## How Far Did I Get?
About seventy percent of the way to the version I had in my head. Some things feel polished. Some things are straight up prototypes. The development is the point and that part is complete.

## AI Tools I Used
ChatGPT  
Gemini  
Claude  
GitHub Copilot  

Each tool had a different purpose. Drafting. Editing. Debugging. Rephrasing. Generating visuals. The real growth came from learning how to steer them.
