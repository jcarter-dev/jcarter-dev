# Prompt Example Three

This was later in the course when I was more comfortable giving the AI specific instructions.

Goal  
Get a more controlled response by giving tone and structure at the same time.

Prompt I used  
Answer these questions separately and keep the writing simple. Make it direct and clear. Nothing extra is needed.

What happened  
The answers came out way cleaner. This is when I understood that the more specific I am, the better the AI works.
