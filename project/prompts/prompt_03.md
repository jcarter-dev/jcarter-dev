# Prompt Example Three

This prompt came from when I needed to define what the prototype would actually include.

Goal  
Break the project into simple features I could implement in a short amount of time.

Prompt I used  
Give me a small feature list for the UI Theme Generator. Just enough to make it a prototype. No big systems. Keep it practical.

What happened  
The AI suggested the core features I ended up building: text input for theme descriptions, a simple rule-based theme picker, color swatches, a Swing-style mock UI, and a generated Java snippet. This is exactly what made it into the prototype.
