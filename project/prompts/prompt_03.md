# Prompt Example Three

This prompt came from the stage where I needed to shape the assistant into something with real features and a manageable scope.

Goal  
Break the assistant into simple features and figure out what a prototype version should actually include.

Prompt I used  
Take this idea and turn it into a small feature list. Keep it simple enough for a first prototype. What should the assistant do, and what is realistic for a short build.

What happened  
The AI suggested a few core features: explain errors in plain language, point out cleaner ways to structure code, highlight sections that might cause bugs, and summarize small changes. It also helped me define how much work a basic version would take. This made the project feel achievable.
