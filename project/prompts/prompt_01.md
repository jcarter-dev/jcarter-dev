# Prompt Example One

This was from the start of the project when I was using AI to help me understand Java concepts.

Goal  
Get a simple explanation that made sense without jargon.

Prompt I used  
Can you explain what a Java class actually does. I know the definition but I want a version that feels clearer.

What happened  
The AI explained it in a way that finally clicked. This is where I realized I could use the assistant to clean up concepts that felt confusing in the textbook.
