# Prompt Example One

This was the start of the project when I was trying to come up with ideas I could actually build for class.

Goal  
Get AI project ideas that made sense for something I already do which is Java UI work.

Prompt I used  
Give me a few AI project ideas that connect to Java and design. Something simple enough to prototype but still useful.

What happened  
One of the ideas was an AI tool that could help with Java UI themes. That idea eventually turned into the Swing Theme Generator prototype I built.
