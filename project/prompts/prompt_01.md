# Prompt Example One

This is one of my early prompts from the start of the course.

Goal  
Get the AI to explain something in a way I could actually use for class without sounding robotic.

Prompt I used  
Explain this topic like you are talking to someone who understands the basics but needs the bigger picture. Keep it simple and keep the flow natural.

What happened  
The AI gave me a decent answer but it still felt generic. This is when I learned that if I do not give it tone and intent it will default to something plain. It pushed me to start thinking about prompting as a real skill instead of just asking a question.
