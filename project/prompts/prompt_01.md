# Prompt Example One

This was from the beginning of the course when I was still figuring out how to talk to the AI.

Goal  
Get a basic explanation that I could understand without it sounding too technical.

Prompt I used  
Can you explain SSH in simple terms. I kind of get it but need a clearer picture.

What happened  
The AI explained it but it felt really plain. This is when I realized I needed to give more direction if I wanted answers I could actually use for class.
