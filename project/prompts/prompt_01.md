# Prompt Example One

This was the first stage of the project where I needed ideas for an AI tool that actually fit into my Java work.

Goal  
Come up with simple, realistic AI project ideas that matched what I already do in class.

Prompt I used  
Can you give me a few AI project ideas that would make sense for someone working in Java. Nothing huge. Just something useful.

What happened  
The AI gave me a short list of ideas. One of them became the AI Workflow Assistant for Java Projects. That is the idea I decided to build my project around.
