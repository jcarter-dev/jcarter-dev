# Prompt Example Two

This prompt shows the point where I needed the idea to be clearer and more focused. The first version was too broad.

Goal  
Take the rough idea and turn it into something I could actually describe as a project.

Prompt I used  
Rewrite Idea 1 so it sounds like a simple project I could build. Keep it practical. Make it feel like it fits my normal Java workflow.

What happened  
The AI cleaned up the idea and made it easier to explain. It helped narrow the purpose down to error explanations, cleaner code suggestions, and short summaries of what changed. This is the version that eventually became my prototype.
