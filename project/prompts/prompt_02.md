# Prompt Example Two

This one shows when I started trying to clean up my writing with the AI instead of just asking for explanations.

Goal  
Make a paragraph sound clearer and more like something I would actually write.

Prompt I used  
Rewrite this so it’s cleaner but still sounds like me. Keep it short and don’t make it too formal.

What happened  
The AI got closer to my tone. This is where I started seeing how small instructions change the whole result.
