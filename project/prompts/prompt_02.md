# Prompt Example Two

This was when I took the idea and needed it to be more focused and practical.

Goal  
Turn the loose idea into something I could explain clearly.

Prompt I used  
Rewrite this idea so it sounds like a real project. Keep it small. Make it clear how AI would help with theme generation.

What happened  
The AI helped me describe the tool as something that takes a theme description and outputs a color palette and Java constants. This made the idea feel much easier to build.
