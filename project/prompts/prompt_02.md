# Prompt Example Two

This prompt shows the point in the semester where I started getting intentional with the AI instead of hoping it would guess what I meant.

Goal  
Sharpen a piece of writing so the tone matched mine. Shorter. Cleaner. More direct.

Prompt I used  
Rewrite this in my style. Keep the rhythm tight. No filler. Make it sound like someone who actually knows what they are talking about.

What happened  
The output jumped in quality. This was where I realized tone instructions matter just as much as the content. The AI can match my voice if I tell it what that voice is supposed to sound like. This was a big shift in my prompting skill.
