# Project Ideation - Joshua Carter

## Idea 1: AI Workflow Assistant for Java Projects

**Problem/Goal:**  
Whenever I’m working on bigger Java projects, I end up losing time hopping between fixing errors, rewriting sections, and trying to explain what actually changed in each commit. I want a small AI tool that can help me make sense of error messages, point out spots in my code that could be cleaner, and give me quick summaries of what I just updated. Basically something that fits into my normal workflow instead of feeling like a whole separate task.

**AI Tool(s):**  
ChatGPT or Gemini (maybe using their APIs), and possibly something tied into a GitHub Action.

**Why This Interests Me:**  
I’m coding in Java pretty much every week right now, so anything that helps me understand errors faster and write cleaner code would make my life easier.

**Rough Scope:**  
Roughly 2–3 weeks to get a simple version working.

## Idea 2: Personal AI Linux Tutor for RHCSA-Style Labs

**Problem/Goal:**  
My Linux class has a lot of hands-on labs — users, permissions, services, scripting, all of it. Sometimes I run the right command but still feel like I’m only half understanding what’s actually happening. This project would create a small AI tutor that uses my own notes and examples to explain commands in plain language and help me compare my output to what I’m expecting to see.

**AI Tool(s):**  
Gemini or ChatGPT for explanations; maybe a small local model through Ollama if I decide to try offline use.

**Why This Interests Me:**  
I’m already doing RHCSA-style tasks regularly, so having something that can break things down the way *I* learn would make studying smoother.

**Rough Scope:**  
1–2 weeks for the basic tutor; around 3 weeks if I add offline model support.

## Idea 3: AI UI Theme Generator for Java Swing

**Problem/Goal:**  
Styling Swing apps can get repetitive, especially when I’m trying to keep everything looking consistent — buttons, headers, backgrounds, gradients, all that. I want an AI tool where I can type something like “dark mode with cyan accents” or “glass theme” and have it generate color values, UI constants, and maybe a sample snippet I can drop straight into my project.

**AI Tool(s):**  
ChatGPT or Claude for the theme generation; Java Swing on my end to apply whatever it outputs.

**Why This Interests Me:**  
I like experimenting with UI themes, but I don’t like rewriting the same setup over and over. This would speed up the boring part and let me focus on the design part I actually enjoy.

**Rough Scope:**  
About 1–2 weeks for a first version that outputs usable theme values.
