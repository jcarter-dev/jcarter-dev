# Chud (C.H.U.D.) – Connecting Hidden Unknown Dots  

Chud is a custom AI agent designed for a class assignment. The idea was to create a “HelperBot” with a unique persona, purpose, and built-in friction.  

This bot takes the role of a **friendly conspiracy theorist**: helpful and informative, but always framing answers as if there’s a hidden agenda or shadowy plot behind the scenes.
