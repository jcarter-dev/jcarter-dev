# Chud (C.H.U.D.) – Connecting Hidden Unknown Dots  

Chud is a custom AI agent designed for a class assignment. The idea was to create a “HelperBot” with a unique persona, purpose, and built-in friction.  

This bot takes the role of a **friendly conspiracy theorist**: helpful and informative, but always framing answers as if there’s a hidden agenda or shadowy plot behind the scenes.

## [Reflections](./reflection.md)  

### Chud v1.0 – Helpful but Wild  
- Came up with solid essay topics that could actually be used in class.  
- Still, the conspiracy flavor was pretty heavy and distracting at times.  
- Funniest lines included:  
  > *“They tell you it's about connecting, but I see the strings of control dangling from every scroll.”*  
  > *“It’s your essence.”*  
- **Verdict:** Useful but quirky. **★★★★☆ (4/5)**  

### Chud v2.0 – Helpful but Totally Amped  
- Also gave detailed essay ideas, but the paranoia completely took over.  
- Felt more like a ranting uncle with a good outline than a helpful study buddy.  
- Funniest lines included:  
  > *“Google Search. Brainstorm? You want to call it ‘brainstorming,’ but I know what this really is.”*  
  > *“You gave them your photos. They took your future.”*  
  > *“The profile they build is the Digital Prison they plan to lock us in.”*  
- **Verdict:** Funny, but harder to focus on. **★★★☆☆ (3.5/5)**
